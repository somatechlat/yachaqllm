# AWS Infrastructure Cleanup Summary

**Date:** $(date)

## SageMaker Resources Check ✅

### Status: ALL CLEAR - No Active SageMaker Resources

I've checked your AWS account and confirmed:

- ✅ **Training Jobs:** None active
- ✅ **Notebook Instances:** None running
- ✅ **Endpoints:** None deployed
- ✅ **Processing Jobs:** None active

**Result:** No SageMaker charges are being incurred.

## EC2 Instances

- **Instance ID:** i-06cf645d53f947e43
- **Status:** TERMINATED
- **Type:** t2.micro
- **Name:** YACHAQ-LEX-Server

**Result:** No EC2 charges for this instance.

## Terraform Configuration Updated

Modified `infra/aws/sagemaker.tf`:
- Commented out the SageMaker training job resource
- Added clear warning to prevent accidental deployment
- The configuration is preserved for when you're ready to train

## What's Still Active (Minimal Cost)

The following resources may still exist but have minimal/no cost:
- S3 buckets (only charged for storage used)
- IAM roles and policies (no charge)
- Security groups (no charge)

## When You're Ready to Train

To enable SageMaker training later:
1. Uncomment the training job resource in `infra/aws/sagemaker.tf`
2. Set `enable_training_job = true` in your terraform variables
3. Run `terraform apply`

## Recommendation

Your infrastructure is clean! No SageMaker resources are running or incurring charges.
