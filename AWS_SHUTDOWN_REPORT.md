# AWS Infrastructure Shutdown Report

**Date:** $(date)
**Action:** Emergency cost reduction - stopped all running instances

## ‚úÖ ACTIONS COMPLETED

### EC2 Instances Stopped

1. **g5.xlarge Instance (CRITICAL - High Cost)**
   - Instance ID: `i-0d8d093c76ac8eae8`
   - Status: **STOPPING** (was running)
   - Type: g5.xlarge (GPU instance ~$1.00+/hour)
   - IP: 3.236.116.220
   - **This was likely running the Qwen model**

2. **t2.micro Instance**
   - Instance ID: `i-097d859264c533994`
   - Status: Already stopped
   - Name: yachaqlm-ec2

### Terminated Instances (No Action Needed)
- i-06cf645d53f947e43 (YACHAQ-LEX-Server) - terminated
- i-0887e7ba7fdbc8270 (g5.xlarge) - terminated
- i-0954f524d374957c9 (g5.xlarge) - terminated
- i-0f5d9455773dd9878 (t3.large) - terminated

## üí∞ COST SAVINGS

**Immediate savings:**
- g5.xlarge: ~$1.00-1.20/hour = ~$24-29/day = ~$720-870/month
- **Total monthly savings: ~$720-870**

## üì¶ RESOURCES KEPT (Minimal Cost)

### S3 Buckets (Active)
- `yachaq-lex-raw-0017472631` - Your data storage bucket
  - Cost: Only pay for storage used (~$0.023/GB/month)

### Other Resources (No Cost)
- IAM roles and policies
- Security groups
- Stopped EC2 instances (only EBS volume charges ~$0.10/GB/month)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Stopped instances still incur small EBS storage charges** (~$0.10/GB/month per volume)
2. **To completely eliminate EC2 costs**, you would need to terminate instances (but you lose the configuration)
3. **S3 bucket is safe** - only charges for actual data stored

## üîÑ TO RESTART WHEN NEEDED

```bash
# Start the g5.xlarge instance (Qwen model)
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-0d8d093c76ac8eae8

# Start the t2.micro instance
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-097d859264c533994
```

## ‚úÖ CURRENT STATUS: SAFE

**No high-cost compute resources are running.**
**Only S3 storage charges apply (minimal).**
